## chapter1 day1 

1- Blockchain is a calculated basis of information that stores data in an electrical form in a numerical format. Someone is structured in a similar way, so that all users without exception have a 3rd supervision, and not a concentrated side. Blockchain differs from the usual basis of information however, as well as one composes the data into "blocks" and also combines them together, so that there is an inconvertible short-term grid of information.

2- Smart contracts are computer codes that are built into blockchains in order to facilitate, verify, or negotiate contract agreements. They operate after users agree on terms of an agreement and set of conditions. Once the set of conditions are met the smart contract carries out the terms of the agreement. This helps participants of said agreements to be certain of the outcome without any type of intermediary.

3- The difference between a script and a transaction is that the transaction changes the information in the blockchain, in which case the script is used to view the information in the blockchain. Transactions generally call for funds for the purpose of paying fees due to blue fuel, fulfillment and prospector. letter. This has every chance of being different means in connection with the blockchain you use.

1- The five cadence programming pillars are: 
Safety/Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, and Resource Oriented Programming
(from flow docs)

2-These columns can be useful according to a large number of factors. The clarity, openness, and craftsmanship of the creators enable newer users to explore the pace as well as create smart contracts with the aim of the jet blockchain. This can also help to make the cipher freely parsable, so that it can be monitored as well as a reliable presence in the audit. Safety/Security is the most significant condition, due to the fact that in the absence of it, not a single person will use the platform in any way.

## Chapter2 Day 2 

1- The factor, according to which I will not in any way generate changeGreeting in the script, is that the script is used only for the purpose of viewing data, it cannot be used for the purpose of actually changing information.

2- In preparation, Authaccount means that the user confirms the transaction. Given in this case, what in the very process makes it possible for a transaction to acquire access to information in your accounting journal, something that can only be done in the preparation stage.

3- The difference between the preparation and execution stages is that the information in your ledger is only available in the preparation stage. The execution stage is capable of generating functions, but in the main it is used for the purpose of logic departments from the preparation phase in order to clean up the cipher.

4 This is done because of this, the fact that a purposeful, and not a string, type was used in the given object.

In order to correct this, the Forced Sweep Manager ! must be attached at the end of the given item [0x03]. This gives it to a practical form, a line, since there is no zero mark.

## Chapter3 Day 1


1 Only 1 type of resource is much to function
Resources must be formed intentionally, and besides eliminated
resources must be "moved" among locations and also have no chance of disappearing


2 NFT is a perfect use of a resource that has to act only once, does not have to be copied in any way, cannot be lost in any way and also requires careful rotation.
Security permissions have every chance of being another good use if you can only acquire a security clearance if you have a security source with you. in the event that you lose your credentials for the purpose of this resource, you are required to renew access, or they have every chance of being presented to another person, but permissions by no means have every chance of being lost or copied.

3 create 

4 Missing. the main term create can only be applied from within the degree of the contract, for this reason, if there is no public function for the purpose of forming a resource, then you will not be able to.

1 The contract code which has all the deployed contracts and the account storage where the data is stored.


2 Storage is where things actually reside. The other paths point to /storage
The main difference between the paths is access.
/storage is only accessible by the account owner in the prepare phase
/public is accessible by anyone and anywhere
private is accessed by account owner and who ever the owner gives access to.

3 
.save() - saves data to a /storage/ path
.load() - takes data out of account storage
.borrow() - gets a reference to the data in account storage

4 The prepare phase is where data is accessed and saved.

5 Only the account owner has access to /storage, so I would have to sign for that save() transaction.

I have changed the collection in this agreement, in conjunction with

In case we meet a number of NFTs, we need to keep in mind any approach to storage, which I notice with any NFT, which is very inefficient is also unnerving. Not a single person has singled out any NFT functions in any way, from which it follows that they only accumulated management records of NFT responsible persons in /storage/.


If you have funds “embedded” in another source, it is advisable for you to proclaim the prohibition by order, which unconsciously destroys the “embedded” repertoires, the presence of help eliminate the primary phrase.


In case I wish to read the data regarding our NFTs from within our Meeting, we currently need to take it from the Meeting in order to do so. Is this good?

Absent, I do not want anyone to be able to form NFTs. In some cases, we need to be able to mint only specific addresses, for example in a whitelist/whitelist scenario. Thus, we need to supplement the source that mints the NFT. In a similar way, only the location that a given source refers to is capable of generating an NFT.

Removing our NFTs from our Collection in order to read something about it is bad, due to the fact that I want to have only a single "container" for the purpose of absolutely all of our NFTs, so that they can possibly exist to be stored in silence for the purpose ease of access and functionality. In order to read our NFTs without getting them from the meeting, we need to add the .borrow() function to our NFT contract, due to the fact that the .borrow() role allows us to look at the information in /storage/.

1 The references have every chance of being useful for the purpose of the FLOW ecosystem, since they inform us, regarding the representation of this, that the smart contract we are analyzing must be an “NFT contract” in the absence of the need to read its full cipher line by line. In a similar way, it can also help girls, as well as DApps in the marketplace, to understand what they are trying to achieve, and also they do not need to perform various functions for the purpose of any NFT contract. This is also useful for the purpose of discussion, due to the fact that they have a model of NFT contracts that you can look at in order to make sure that what they contain in such a case is what follows (and also, therefore, they do not not-so-bad NFTs).
